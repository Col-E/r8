# Guide to Keep Annotations

## Disclaimer

The annotation library described here is in development and considered to be in
its prototype phase. As such it is not yet feature complete, but we are actively
working on supporting all of the use cases we know of. Once the design exits the
prototype phase, it is intended to move to an R8 independent library as part of
androidx. All feedback: criticism, comments and suggestions are very welcome!

## Introduction

When using a Java/Kotlin shrinker such as R8 or Proguard, developers must inform
the shrinker about parts of the program that are used either externally from the
program itself or internally via reflection and therefore must be kept.

Traditionally these aspects would be kept by writing keep rules in a
configuration file and passing that to the shrinker.

The keep annotations described in this document represent an alternative method
using Java annotations. The motivation for using these annotations is foremost
to place the description of what to keep closer to the program point using
reflective behavior. Doing so more directly connects the reflective code with
the keep specification and makes it easier to maintain as the code develops. In
addition, the annotations are defined independent from keep rules and have a
hopefully more clear and direct meaning.


## Build configuration

To use the keep annotations your build must include the library of
annotations. It is currently built as part of each R8 build and if used with R8,
you should use the matching version. You can find all archived builds at:

```
https://storage.googleapis.com/r8-releases/raw/<version>/keepanno-annotations.jar
```

Thus you may obtain version `8.2.34` by running:

```
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/r8-releases/raw/8.2.34/keepanno-annotations.jar
```

You will then need to set the system property
`com.android.tools.r8.enableKeepAnnotations` to instruct R8 to make use of the
annotations when shrinking:

```
java -Dcom.android.tools.r8.enableKeepAnnotations=1 \
  -cp r8.jar com.android.tools.r8.R8 \
  # ... the rest of your R8 compilation command here ...
```

### Annotating code using reflection

The keep annotation library defines a family of annotations depending on your
use case. You should generally prefer `@UsesReflection` where applicable.
